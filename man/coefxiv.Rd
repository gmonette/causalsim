\title{Regression coefficient from a linear DAG possibly using an IV}
\usage{
coefxiv(fmla, dag, iv = NULL, var = covld(to_dag(dag)), nadj = 30)
}
\arguments{
\item{fmla}{a linear model formula. The variables
in the formula must be column names of 
\code{dag}. For IV estimation, the right
hand side should have two variables, the
first one will be treated as the 'X'
variable and the second, as the IV.}

\item{dag}{a square matrix defining a linear DAG. The
column names and row names of A must be 
identical.  The non-diagonal entries of 
\code{dag} contain the causal of coefficients
of arrows pointing from the column variable
to the row variable.  The diagonal entries
are standard deviations of the normally
distributed independent component generating
the row variable. A matrix
defines a linear dag if the same permutation
of its rows and columns can transform it into
a lower diagonal matrix.}

\item{iv}{a one-sided formula with a single variable (at present)
specifying a variable to be used as an instrumental variable}

\item{var}{the variance matrix of the variables, as an alternative
input to 'dag'. If 'var' is provided, then dag does not
need to be provided.}

\item{nadj}{sample size to calculate adjusted R-squared. Default: 30.}
}
\value{
a list with class 'coefx' containing 
       the population coefficient for the first
       predictor variable in \code{fmla}, the residual 
       standard error of the regression, the conditional
       standard deviation of the residual of the first
       predictor and the ratio of the last two quantities
       which constitutes the 'standard error factor' which,
       if multiplied by 1/sqrt(n) is an estimate of the
       standard error of the estimate of the regression
       coefficient for the first predictor variable.
}
\description{
Given a linear DAG, find the population regression 
coefficient for X using IV estimation
using data with the marginal covariance
structure implied by the linear DAG.
